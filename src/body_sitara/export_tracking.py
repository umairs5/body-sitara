"""
Stable left-to-right person-slot tracking for the dense per-frame export
mode (see process_video's export_dir/dense_export kwargs), and for
PersonState's encryption/consent-recovery path (see PersonIdentityTracker
below).

Both trackers solve the same underlying problem: rtmlib's det_model()/
pose_model() (and yolo_seg's own detect head) return each frame's people in
whatever order the underlying model happened to produce that frame -- NOT a
stable, identity-persistent order. Naively keying anything long-lived (a
PersonState, an export slot) by raw per-frame array index silently breaks
the moment detection order reshuffles: index 0 can refer to a different
physical person on frame N+1 than it did on frame N, with no error or
signal that this happened. Confirmed as a real bug this way: in a 3-person
clip, PersonState's old raw-index keying let two different encrypted
streams both end up with their best-confidence face crop pulled from the
SAME middle physical person (whichever slot they happened to occupy on
their own best-confidence frame), corrupting which stream's embedding
actually represents which bystander -- exactly the data Tier 3 matching and
restoration depend on being correct.

ExportSlotTracker (small, FIXED slot count, e.g. 0/1/2) and
PersonIdentityTracker (unbounded, IDs created/retired as people appear/
leave) both use the same greedy nearest-centroid matching, just over
different-shaped identity spaces.
