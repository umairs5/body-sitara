class GenderClassifier:
    """InsightFace genderage.onnx (buffalo_l pack, MobileNet-0.25 backbone),
    run via InsightFace's own insightface.model_zoo.attribute.Attribute
    class rather than a hand-rolled preprocessing pipeline.

    Chosen over the earlier Levi & Hassner (gender_googlenet.onnx) model
    after an empirical comparison (scripts/diag_gender_model_compare.py,
    scratch/meeting_prep/diag_gender_model_compare_results.json): this
    model is ~1-6ms/crop vs. 90-2000ms/crop for Levi & Hassner on the same
    hardware, and gender_googlenet.onnx turned out to be a documented
    misnomer -- it's the Levi & Hassner 2015 3-conv AlexNet-derivative, not
    GoogLeNet, per the original OpenCV age-gender sample.

    Reusing Attribute directly (not a reimplementation) sidesteps two
    subtle bugs already found and fixed once during diagnostics: (1) a
    double-translation bug in a hand-rolled alignment matrix that produced
    an all-black warped crop, and (2) assuming the wrong input_mean/
    input_std normalization constants -- Attribute.__init__ inspects the
    ONNX graph itself to pick the right constants per checkpoint (0.0/1.0
    for this file, not the commonly-assumed 127.5/128.0).

    Attribute.get() only returns (argmax_gender, age) -- no confidence.
    predict() below duplicates its forward pass (same alignment, same
    input_mean/input_std/input_size Attribute.__init__ already resolved)
    only to keep the pre-argmax logits long enough to softmax them into a
    real confidence, which the manifest's per-slot vote-aggregation
    (pipeline.py) weights by.

        fit to _ARCFACE_DST_3PT -- not the crude bbox-center-and-scale
        fallback predict() below uses on an already-cropped, axis-aligned
        square. Rotates a tilted head upright and frames the face the same
        way InsightFace's own 5-point norm_crop does (minus the 2 mouth
        points we don't have), instead of relying on derive_face_crop's
        nose-centered square, which was tuned for "reliably contains the
        whole face" rather than "matches training-time alignment."

        left_eye/right_eye here are COCO ANATOMICAL left/right (the
        subject's own left/right, so "left_eye" appears on the image's
        RIGHT side when facing the camera) -- same convention derive_face_
        crop/pose.py already use. _ARCFACE_DST_3PT's row order is IMAGE-
        left/right (row 0 = smaller x = appears on the image's left side),
        confirmed empirically: feeding COCO order straight through
        (anatomical-left -> dst row 0) fit a transform with a ~83 degree
        rotation component for an upright, roughly-frontal face -- an
        obviously-wrong result that reproduced as a ~90-degree-rotated,
        mis-cropped output image during verification (scripts/
        verify_gender_100.py). Swapping fixed it: rotation term drops to
        near-zero for the same frontal-face input. Do not "simplify" this
        swap away without re-verifying against real images -- it looks like
        it shouldn't matter but empirically does.
