"""
mDNS (DNS-SD) advertisement for the Tier1 link server (plan section 2.1).
Pure convenience -- lets the phone find "the bodySITARA device on this
network" instead of the user typing an IP. Not a security boundary:
TOFU-pinned HTTPS (see cert.py) is what actually protects the connection;
mDNS just answers "where is it," the same way Avahi would on the real Pi.

Service type: _bodysitara._tcp.local. -- a private, unregistered service
type, fine for a research rig (real products register with IANA).
